          <span class="byline"><h3>Curriculum Philosophy<br></h3> </span>
          <p>It takes many years of experience and many failed attempts before an education professional can bring together and master
          all of the elements necessary to create an effective learning environment.  Each teacher's classroom is unique and will be run
          in a different manner.  Novice Educators can identify strategies and best practices that are universal in their effectiveness in
          creating an optimal learning environment. Below are some of the guiding principles I have foudn effective for instruction.</p>
          <ol style="list-style:circle; padding:2em; color:#483949;">
           <div class="imageBack" style="background-image:url('images/pic07.jpg')"><li class="backList"><h4 class="backList">Materials and Organization</h4> ensuring that you and the students have a quick and easy access to all notes, assignments, and other
            materials is essential in saving time and eliminating stress on the part of teacher and student alike.
            Eliminating down time during lessons, and eliminating the task for teachers of finding assignments for students who were missing, or
            or when they have misplaced their materials, having a system in place which you have taught your students to access will
            make life easier for everyone.  Ideally in this day and age all class materials will be organized shared electronically so that both
            teacher and student can access what they need, from any device.</li></div> &nbsp
          <li><h4>Aviod Monotonous, Repetitive Lessons</h4> Aside from the fact that sitting down every day and taking notes, then regurgitating the
          information on a worksheet is boring, research shows that these type of teaching methods are ineffective. There is an ancient Chinese proverb that goes; <br>
          <blockquote style="margin:0px, 200px;" style="text-align:center;">Tell me, I forget<br>
          Show me, I remember<br>
          Involve me, I understand<br></blockquote>
          I design all my curriculum with the goal of fostering learning that is developmentally appropriate and teaches skills and habits of mind,
          not just facts from a textbook. The ultimate goal is for students to be engaged in building upon their own knowledge.  Most of the activities
          I have included in here involve more experiential learning and provide lots of opportunity for students to interact, ask questions, and problem
          solve independently.
           </li> &nbsp
          <div class="imageBack" style="background-image:url('images/pic08.jpg')"><li class="backList"><h4 class="backList">Short, Frequent Assessment</h4>High pressure assessments are stressful for students. Creating one large summative assessment that
          counts as a major percentage of a student's grade can overwhelm and go beyond the capacity of
          younger students' threshold of sustained concentration.  Including short, frequent quizzes gives students the chance to
          concentrate on a few problems that allow them to give an example of what they know. These kind of short, frequent checks are also useful as
          formative diagnostic tests to see whether studenets are ready to move on to another topic, or whether it would be wise to spend
          more time deepening understanding of concepts that students are going to use as a foundation to build upon later.</li> &nbsp
          </div>
          <li><h4>Build Bridges, Not Walls</h4>Kids are by and large eager to do their best for a teacher that they like and respect.  Build the foundations for success
          with your students by earning their trust and respect, and then establishing a relationship wherein students are intrinsically motivated
          to be their best every day.  Even if this approach doesn't work with every kid, every day, you have build the kind of classroom environment
          that is supportive of positive change and includes a majority of students who want to help make sure all members
          of the classroom are contributing to a positive environment</li> &nbsp
          <div class="imageBack" style="background-image:url('images/pic07.jpg')"><li class="backList"><h4 class="backList">Clear Expectations</h4>A student who doen't know what is required cannot possibly meet your expectations. A clear layout of what students
          must do to recieve good grades is something all students want.  No student ever walks in to a classroom hoping to fail.
          Give clear written directions, like checklists to outline what is required of students.  After you correct work, give clear feedback to students
          about what they did right and wrong (rubrics that state specific, measurable goals a very helpful) and allow students to correct certain parts of the work the did not do
          correctly.  One must also communicate to students through structured grading and feedback.  With some classes and students,
          a requirment for  apart of their grade of keeping their assignments organized, and keeping track of their grade at the semesters progress will make a
          remarkable impact on the level of student learning.
