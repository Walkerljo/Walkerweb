      <p class="text"> Hi. I'm a 7th grader at West Ridge Middle School. I enjoy electronics, athletics, and hunting. My favorite subject in school is math. This is my first year at coding. It's really enjoyable to be able to create something
      so beautiful out of just typing.
      To think that almost a year ago I wasn't even aware about how much I was missing.
      I wasn't able to comprehend that there is a whole world of technology that lies in the background of our world. I've been practicing it nonstop, so when our school entered into this competiton, I knew I'd love it. I'm happy with my team's efforts in creating this website
      and I really love our web design.

      <p class="text">Hello.<br>

My name is Weiyi Huang and I was one of the members that helped contribute to this webpage designing program.<br>

It all started like this. It was one day at my school. The announcements were going through their usual boring and repetitive information about the clubs and the tryouts and everything else but leaving the birthdays for last. I was listening to it for anything important but then heard about a special announcement. “Are you a technological genius?” the speaker announced. “Or do you just want to have fun with technology? Come and join the technological student’s association. Meetings starts next…” But by that time I wasn’t listening to it anymore. I was thinking, why not try it out? It would be fun. So I came and from that day, I had something to do everyday that I came. It was a combination of research, coding, and learning new things. But unfortunately, I came a little too late and couldn’t come to the competitions and that was the unfortunate thing. All I had to do and could do was just say “Ok.” It was a fun experience for me to work on this website design and had a lot of fun doing it. Hopefully, we will get a good rating for this website, but it was a good experience overall.

      <p class="text">My name is Ellie Cohen, and I am  an 8th grader at West Ridge Middle School in Austin, TX.   I was inspired to participate in this contest after learning HTML and CSS in a class in the fall semester.  I have always loved coding, but before that elective, I had never experimented with website design.  I found that I really love to code in HTML and CSS!  
I have had an interest in space since around 1st grade.    My room has a lot of evidence of my space obsessions.  There are posters of space on my walls, and glow in the dark rocket ships and stars on the ceiling.  I was really surprised and excited when I found out that we were going to code a website about space.  My inner first grader was ecstatic when I got to interview astronaut Loren Shriver.  
Besides coding, I like to play softball, and act and build the sets for our school play.
