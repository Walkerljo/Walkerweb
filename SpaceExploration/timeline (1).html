      <h2>X-15 Rocket Plane</h2>
      <p>One of the first space vehicles. It made almost 200 flights. It gave information that proved vital to both the space race and the creation of the space shuttle.

      <h2>Project Mecury</h2>
      <p>The Mecury was initialed in 1958. This spacecraft made Alan Shepard, the pilot of the freedom 7, become the first American in space. At this time, the Soviet Union was leading the space race. 3 orbital flights were made. <br>Source: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mercury/missions/overview-intro.html</p>

      <h2>Project Gemini</h2>
      <p>Project Gemini focused on conducting experiments and developing practice techniques for lunar missions. The first Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was launched on March 23, 1965. Nine other missions followed. These space missions gathered information about weightlessness on humans. The Gemini missions also included the first space walk, and allowed a way to dock space crafts. <br>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini</p>

      <h2>Apollo Program</h2>
      <p>One of the most expensive programs ever. It is estimated to have costed 191 billion dollars in present day USD. It used larger launch vehicles, Saturn rockets. The Apollo made major milestones in human space flight. It's one of the few missions that has successfully gotten men beyond low Earth orbit and placed humans on other celestial bodies. The Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body.<br> Source: http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/apollo_program.html</p>

      <h2>Skylab</h2>
      <p>Skylab was the first and only space stations that the U.S. built independently. It was 169,950 lbs and was launched on May 14, 1973. Damaged during launch by loss of its protection and one electricity-generating solar panels, though it was repaired by the first crew. It was occupied for 171 days by 3 successful crews in 1973 and 1974. It was used to study microgravity. <br>Source: https://www.nasa.gov/missions/shuttle/f_skylab1.html</p>

      <h2>Apollo-Soyuz Test Project</h2>
      <p>The Cold War was ending when the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was introduced. It was a group of Soviet Union and U.S. space programs. It was the last U.S. Apollo flight in addition to being the last manned space launch until the space shuttle. This project provided useful engineering experience for future joint US-Russian space flights, such as the International Space Station.<br> Source: http://www.space.com/20833-apollo-soyuz.html</p>

      <h2>Space Shuttle Program</h2>
      <p>It was originally thought of as the most fequently launchable and most reusable vehicle. Four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. Missions could last from 5-17 days with crews of 2-8 astronauts. The program lasted for 30 years and sent over 300 astronauts into space.
